    <h2>Crash Course Computer Science #1</h2>

    <p>In 1944, one of the biggest electro mahanical computer was built by IBM and was called the Harvard Mark 1. It contained over 765000 components, three million connections, and five hundred miles of wire.
        A 50 foot shaft was drivin through the machine to keep its internal machanics syncronized. One of the earliest uses for this technology was running simulations for the Manhattan Project. Relays were the brains for these computers. 
        In a relay there is a wire that determins whether theircut is opened or closed. The wire connects to another coil of wire inside the relay. An electormagnetic field is created when current is flowing throught he coil.
        When the current is flowing through the coil, it attracts a metal arm inside the relay, snapping it shut and completing the circut. The Harvard Mark 1 was able to do 3 additions or subtractions per second, multiply in 6 seconds, divide in 15 seconds, and more complex operations took over a minute.
        In 1947,operaters removed a dead moth from inside the Harvard Mark 2 and from then on, anything that went wrong with a computer, it was called a bug. In 1907, vacuum tubes were created that were more efficient than the relay and they had no moving parts. 
        This meant that there was less wear and it could be switched tousands of times per second.
        These tubes became the basis of radios, long distance telephones, and other devices for nearly half a century. The vacuume tubes were first used in a large scale for the Colossus Mark 1 and was used to decrypt Nazi communications.
        The ENIAC was completed in the University of Pennsylvania and was the first general purpose, programmable, and electronic computer. It could operate for half a day before breaking down.

    <h2>CCCR #2</h2>
    <h3>June 24</h3>

    <p>The abacus was the earliest device for computing and was used for simple calculations with the botom row representing a power of one, the second last row with a power of 10 and so on. This was used to add and subtract and was created becuase society was too large to keep track inside ones head.
        As people got smarter and was exposed to new devices, we created clocks, slide rules, and more to help with calculations and was convenient for counting and methods for telling the time, lattitude as sea and more. However none of these machines were called computers. A computer was a job where people
        who helped with calculations, somtimes with the help of machines but ususally was done by hand. The meaning of "computer" began shifting in the late 1800s as the job was not as well known and the word was used in contect of machines. The first machine that was automated to calculate divisions, additions,
        subtractions, and multiplications. This machine was so successful that it was used for the next three centuries of calculator designs. The military also needed some aid from computers or fast calculations to fire shells at a target. They struggled to hit something as big as a ship so they were given a table that
        allowed them to look up the environmental conditions and the distance they wanted to fire to find a way to hit thier target. This method was so accurate that it was used a bit in WW2. By the end of the 19th century, computers were used for special purpose tasks and was not common in domestic and a regular life.
