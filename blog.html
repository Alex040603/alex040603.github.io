    <h2>Crash Course Computer Science #1</h2>
    <h3>June 11th</h3>
    <p>In 1944, one of the biggest electro mahanical computer was built by IBM and was called the Harvard Mark 1. It contained over 765000 components, three million connections, and five hundred miles of wire.
        A 50 foot shaft was drivin through the machine to keep its internal machanics syncronized. One of the earliest uses for this technology was running simulations for the Manhattan Project. Relays were the brains for these computers. 
        In a relay there is a wire that determins whether theircut is opened or closed. The wire connects to another coil of wire inside the relay. An electormagnetic field is created when current is flowing throught he coil.
        When the current is flowing through the coil, it attracts a metal arm inside the relay, snapping it shut and completing the circut. The Harvard Mark 1 was able to do 3 additions or subtractions per second, multiply in 6 seconds, divide in 15 seconds, and more complex operations took over a minute.
        In 1947,operaters removed a dead moth from inside the Harvard Mark 2 and from then on, anything that went wrong with a computer, it was called a bug. In 1907, vacuum tubes were created that were more efficient than the relay and they had no moving parts. This meant that there was less wear and it could be switched tousands of times per second.
        These tubes became the basis of radios, long distance telephones, and other devices for nearly half a century. The vacuume tubes were first used in a large scale for the Colossus Mark 1 and was used to decrypt Nazi communications.
        The ENIAC was completed in the University of Pennsylvania and was the first general purpose, programmable, and electronic computer. It could operate for half a day before breaking down.
