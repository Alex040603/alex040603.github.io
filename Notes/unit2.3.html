            <h3>Structures</h3>
            <p class="notesColor">struct I-Phone {</p>
            <p class="notesColor">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;const year : int</p>
            <p class="notesColor">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;const version : string</p>
            <p class="notesColor">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;const dimesions : double</p>
            <p class="notesColor">}</p>
            <p class="notesColor">func explain I-Phone {</p>
            <p class="notesColor">print("This I-Phone was made in \(year), its version is the \(version) and its dimesions are \(dimesions)"</p>
            <p class="notesColor">}</p>
            <p>The example above is for Structures. "struct" is a blueprint for a cirtain thing like a car, shirt, or I-Phone.
                In this case, the I-Phone is recieving its properties such as dimesions, version, and year which each make
                up the I-Phone. The function is using the "blueprints" of the phone for
            </p>
            <h3>Initializers</h3>
            <p>Used to return a new instance of a type. For strings it's String.init(), intigers is Int.init(), and for bools
                it's Bool.init();. The default value, in that order, is "", 0, and false. You can also ommit the "init" and
                just have, for example, String().
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Memberwise Initializers</h3>
            <p>Used for adding a default value. It also gives a specific value. Such as: let age = Age (count:15)</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Custom Initializers</h3>
            <p>Used to give something a custom value that it calculate/influenced by another. It's
               used within structs. Pretend the following example is within a struct with 2 values: cm and m :
            <p class="notesColor">init(cm : Double) {</p>
            <p class="notesColor">self.cm = cm</p>
            <p class="notesColor">m =cm * 100</p>
            <p class="notesColor">}</p>
            ^ The value cm is influenced by m. As m increases, so does cm.
