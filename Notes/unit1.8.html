    <h2>Story Boards</h2>
    <P>The screen that lets you customize the visual aspect of your app. You can add buttons, lebels,
        a title, and more. Opened by clicking main.storyboard</P>
    
    <h2>Outlets and Actions</h2>
    <p>When you have an object that you want the user to interact with, buttons and interactive 
        elements, you can drag the object to the view controller. When you place the object in the code, you can 
        make an outlet or action. An outlet connects the object to the code, it is usually when an object will change
        in any way, color, size, etc. 
        The connected prodect should look like: <p class = notesColor>@IBOutlet weak var labelName: UILabel!</p> 
        <br>
        An action is used to run commands when using an object. For example, changing the text on the app when pressing a button is an action.
        The action should look like: <p class = notesColor >@IBAction func changeTitle(_ sender: UIButton) {</p>
                                    <p class = notesColor >&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mainLabel.text = "this app rocks"</p>
                                     <p class = notesColor >}</p>
        In this example, the label is changed to "This app rocks" when the button is pressed.
        
    </p>
