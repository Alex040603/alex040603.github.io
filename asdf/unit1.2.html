        <h1 id="homepagetitle">Constants,Variable, and Data Types</h1>
    </header>
    <h3>Constants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A value that cannot change</li>
        <li>Represented as "let"</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A value that can change</li>
        <li>Represented as "var"</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Type Inference</h3>
    <p>Is when the computer guesses, or infers, the value's type in code when it is not declared. 
       For example: -let numberOfSteps = 9-  the computer infers that the 9 is an int becuase 9 doesn't have an
       associated type. Same thing if the number of steps was 8.4, is would be treated as a double. To avoid
       type inference, it is good to decalre the type with a value as this avoids type inference.</p>
       <br>
    <h3>Type annotaion</h3>
    <p>is when you declare the type of the value in a let or var statement.
       it is shown as the following: let weight:Double = 45.7 
       the :Double is declaring that the following value is of that type. Same goes for Int but it 
       is not always nessesary for boolean and strings as type inference will declare it for you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Types</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Int</li>
        <li>Double</li>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Int</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Any natural number (0-infinity)</li>
        <li>Indicated with "Int"</li>
        <li>Eg: let numberOfSteps:Int = 600</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Double</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Any decimal number</li>
        <li>Can assign a whole number as a decimal - Eg: let number:Double = 9</li>
        <li>The 9 is treated as 9.0 (now a double)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>String</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Words and letters</li>
        <li>Can be names, made up words, etc (as long as it has letters</li>
        <li>Is written, and needed, with quotaion marks eg: "a random word"</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Boolean</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A value with only 2 possible outcomes -true or false-</li>
        <li>Eg: let isMorning:Boolean = True</li>
    </ul>
